<h2 style="color: green;background-color: red;"> I am a junior from Centenary University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Analytics! </h2>

<p style="color:blueviolet";> One of my current interest is lacrosse. It has lead me to meet many people and see and experince many new things.
    I enjoy both watching and playing the sport. I started playing and high school and really fell in love with it!
    I am currently playing in college and enjoy the experience throughly. I like going to games in person for both D1 college games as well as professional games.
    In the future I would love the opportunity to coach or give back to the sport in any way I possibly could.
